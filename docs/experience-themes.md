# Experience themes

Ping Island themes coordinate the parts of an experience that should feel like
one product—not just a color palette:

```text
IslandExperienceTheme
├── Visual       surfaces, borders, typography, icon language and window chrome
├── Interaction  allow / scoped allow / deny / neutral control appearance
├── Motion       press feedback and panel-transition timing
└── Sound
    ├── Lifecycle     processing, attention, completion, error, resource limit
    └── Auxiliary     launch, new session, approvals, reminders and usage edges
```

A CESP/OpenPeon sound pack is different: it is an optional **audio-only
override**. It never changes the selected theme's UI, icons, geometry or motion.

The screen-attached notch is intentionally outside the visual theme boundary.
It always keeps Ping Island's canonical black surface, icon language and motion,
so changing a Settings theme cannot recolor the macOS notch area. Detached
panels and Settings remain theme-aware.

## Built-in experiences

Choose a theme from **Settings → Sound → Experience theme**.

| Theme | Visual language | Recommended audio |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PingIsland native** | Ping Island's dark glass surfaces, rounded controls and existing icon treatment | The original built-in 8-bit mappings, extended to the new semantic moments |
| **macOS** | Native titlebar and traffic lights, a full-height source-list sidebar, outline SF Symbols, system materials and semantic system colors | macOS system sounds |
| **Pixel** | Silkscreen type, code-rendered pixel icons, square controls and pixel grid surfaces | AgentIsland's game-style 8-bit mappings |

Pixel is one theme family with two selectable palettes:

- **Arcade Neon** — deep arcade navy with high-contrast cyan accents.
- **Game Boy Olive** — deep handheld olive surfaces, the classic yellow-green
  accent, and accessibility-adjusted light foregrounds.

Both palettes share the same components, motion and sound profile. The palette
is persisted independently, so adding a third Pixel colorway does not require a
new top-level theme or a copy of its sound mapping.

### Visual reference

Selecting a theme applies its recommended sound source and lifecycle mapping.
Users can still customize the five lifecycle sounds afterwards, or select a
local CESP/OpenPeon pack. Changing only the Pixel palette does not reset audio.

## Settings window shell and themed content

The Settings window has one shared native AppKit shell for every theme. It owns
the titled/resizable/full-screen window, unified titlebar, native traffic
lights, titlebar dragging and content insets. Content-area background dragging
is disabled so sliders and other interactive controls always own their pointer
gestures. The shell's backing is
transparent, so the active theme's sidebar and detail surfaces continue behind
the traffic lights instead of leaving a fixed-color strip across the top. Theme
code does not draw replacement traffic lights or intercept window dragging.
One AppKit backdrop owns the base color across the full window, while the native
safe area keeps the titlebar as an exclusive top region. Window-mode SwiftUI
content adds controls and optional Pixel grid texture without repainting the
translucent base, so the bar and body match without double-compositing. Both
columns retain explicit spacing below the titlebar.

Inside that shell, each theme owns its sidebar rows and content surfaces:

- **PingIsland native** keeps the project's original colored icon tiles,
  two-line labels, rounded glass cards and category accents.
- **macOS** uses the compact source-list treatment: outline SF Symbols,
  single-line labels, system accent selection and sidebar material extending
  behind the native traffic lights.
- **Pixel** uses code-rendered pixel glyphs, one-pixel corners, grid surfaces and
  its selected classic palette. Grid texture belongs to each surface background;
  it never renders above labels, icons, previews or controls.

Category selection is split into an immediate selection update and deferred
detail construction. Category-specific refresh work is cancellable and cached,
so returning to Display, Statistics or Sound does not repeatedly block the
sidebar response.

`NotchView` does not consume theme surface or motion tokens. It fixes the docked
notch to black and supplies the canonical PingIsland visual theme to its child
controls. This boundary is separate from `DetachedIslandPanelView`, which may
continue to use the selected experience theme.

## Semantic feedback moments

Product code emits an `AppSoundFeedbackEvent`; it never names an audio file.
The selected theme resolves that intent to either a system sound, a bundled
8-bit sound, or a compatible CESP fallback.

The original configurable moments remain:

- processing started;
- attention required;
- task completed;
- task error; and
- resource limit / compaction.

The architecture also covers launch, Island detachment, new sessions, allow,
scoped allow, deny, five-minute waiting reminders, crossing 90% usage, usage
recovery to 20% or less, and three rapid submissions within ten seconds.

Transition detection lives in `ExperienceSoundTransitions.swift`. It is theme
agnostic: it decides *what happened*, then `AppSoundFeedback` and the active
profile decide *how it sounds*. Imported CESP v1 packs do not define every new
category, so each cue documents a compatible lifecycle fallback.

## Action semantics and accessibility

Confirmation actions retain one meaning in every theme:

- Green + checkmark + label: allow this operation.
- Blue + scoped-check icon + label: allow within the current scope or session.
- Red + cross + label: deny the operation.
- Gray/neutral + hand-off icon + label: continue in the originating app.

Color is never the only indication. Controls keep labels, icons, accessibility
hints, contrast, and reduced-motion-safe press feedback in every theme.

```

`AppLocalizedRootView` resolves the persisted family and Pixel palette, then
injects one `IslandExperienceTheme` through SwiftUI's environment. Child views
read `@Environment(\.islandExperienceTheme)` rather than reaching into settings
or defining a private palette.

The persisted PingIsland identifier remains `standard`, and PingIsland 原生 is
the default for fresh installs and invalid or missing persisted theme values.
Do not rename it: the raw value is intentionally retained to migrate existing
installations safely.

## Adding a first-party theme

Themes are compiled in; third-party UI bundles are not a runtime extension point
yet. To add a new first-party family:

1. Add a stable raw-value case to `ExperienceThemeID`. Never rename an existing
   persisted value.
2. Create `<Name>ExperienceTheme.swift` and provide every Visual, Interaction,
   Motion, lifecycle Sound and auxiliary Sound token.
3. Register one representative definition in `ExperienceThemeRegistry.all` and
   resolve variants explicitly in `theme(for:pixelPalette:)` (or a generalized
   equivalent if the new family has variants).
4. Add an explicit `settingsChromeStyle` only when the theme needs a distinct
   Settings sidebar component. Keep native titlebar and dragging behavior in
   `SettingsWindowController` instead of reproducing it in the theme.
5. Use semantic controls and `AppSoundFeedback.play(_:)`. Do not choose action
   colors or concrete sound files in feature views.
6. If a new feedback moment is needed, add a semantic event and a pure transition
   evaluator, then supply a cue in every built-in theme.
7. Add registry, mapping, persistence and transition assertions to the Xcode
   test target, and update this user-facing table.

To add only a Pixel colorway, add a `PixelThemePaletteID` case and its palette
tokens inside `PixelExperienceTheme`; do not copy the Pixel components or sound
profile.

## Verification

The test suite verifies registration uniqueness, all three visual contracts,
Pixel palette persistence, shared Pixel audio, complete lifecycle/auxiliary cue
coverage, theme-recommended mappings and transition thresholds. Run both:

```sh
xcodebuild -project PingIsland.xcodeproj -scheme PingIsland \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' test -only-testing:PingIslandTests
swift test --package-path Prototype
```
